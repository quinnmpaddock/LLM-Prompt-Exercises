I recently have been playing around with agentic artificial intelligence, more specifically Abacus AI’s Deep Agent. It is a very competent software developer, analyst, and planner, and I even have had some success promoting the agent to engineer simple hardware from scratch.
Given that the agent is capable of all this, and given that LLMs are generally excellent at writing English, I wanted to see how well such an agent could apply its reasoning and planning abilities to a creative work.
TO BE CLEAR, I do not believe that AI is yet capable of truly creative works, nor do they need to be. One could argue that art is made valuable in part by the inherent human experience instilled in it by its creator. Whether this is what you believe or not, it seems as though the general consensus remains that AI has not produced a clear creative effort that humans experience the same way they would a work by another human.
My experiment was not an attempt to produce more “slop,” rather to see what types of reasoning cutting edge agentic AI is capable of. How well can such a system creatively extrapolate? How much of an understanding can an agent have of concepts like intelligence, politics, and the future?

To test this (albeit in an amateur way) I drafted a detailed prompt for the agent, found in uploads. I encourge reading it. I asked the agent to consider the various laws of technological accelleration
and then write a 15000 word novelette about an entity at some point in our future. I found the results to be shockingly thought out. Look through first folder in the repo to see the agent's response.
The actual novelette is labled "novelette.pdf".

It seems as though AI is closer to contenxual extrapolation and creative thinking than many of us realise. I encourage anyone to remodel my prompt in any way they see fit, as long as it fits
